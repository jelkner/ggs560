    "In IPCC AR5 (IPCC 2013), the global surface temperature changes are calculated based on different data sets for different periods. One of them is using the GISS data set. The result for the period 1979-2012 is that the temperature changes 0.161 +/- 0.033 oC per decade. \n",

An old version of the data partially cleaned is also included with the package. Please use the provided data in the period 1979-2012 for the following questions:\n",
